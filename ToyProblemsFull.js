//Given an arbitrary input string, return the first non-repeated character in the string. For example:
firstNonRepeatedCharacter(‘ABA’); // => ‘B’
firstNonRepeatedCharacter(‘AABCABD’); // => ‘C’

// Write a function called combinator that is given two arrays as arguments. The first array is an array of first names, and the second array is an array of last names. Have the function return a new array combining the first names and the last names.

// Write a function that takes in a string and returns the reverse of that string.  

// Using the JavaScript language, have the function FirstFactorial(num) take the num parameter being passed and return the factorial of it (ie. if num = 4, return (4 * 3 * 2 * 1)). For the test cases, the range will be between 1 and 18. 

// Write a Function called simpleSymbols that takes in a string parameter and determines if it is an acceptable sequence by either returning the string true or false. The str parameter will be composed of + and = symbols with several letters between them (ie. ++d+===+c++==a) and for the string to be true each letter must be surrounded by a + symbol. So the string to the left would be false. The string will not be empty and will have at least one letter. 

//Write a function called ABCheck that takes a string parameter and return the string true if the characters a and b are separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once (ie. "lane borrowed" would result in true because there is exactly three characters between a and b). Otherwise return the string false.

//Write a function that generates an array of integers of the Fibonacci sequence, up to i = 100. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, which means to find Fn you add the previous two numbers up. The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1. Write a function to check if a given number is in the Fibonacci sequence, return "yes" if it is, if not return the string "no."
